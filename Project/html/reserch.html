            <p>So,we have done research on many things like creating and doing all the HTML codes.We have learned many things how can 
                solve the problem how do we face it and whats the reason the problem is being caused .Many reference are kept where we learned 
                a lot things and make our work more catchy.Our team made a research on ecommers website and how to make the pages as we want.The 
                reference are kept at the bottom last of this page which helped us to make website.

            </div>
        <br>
        <div class="researchpage">
            <p>The above shown figure shows how can solve the navbar problem.In the first figure the nav bar is coming down while we scroll 
                the page.It can be fixed by many ways .It's easy and hard to find the codes .It took me while to solve the problem.The second 
                picture shows the solved navbar.The codes named"position" of the navbar should be kept fixed.Thats how we can solve the problem.
                It's easy to solve after we know the solution.So,this was the research we did on the navbarproblem solving.This was quite hard
                our team did the research and solved it .It was a easy step to do but as a begginer it was hard for us.So this was the solution
                and explantion of how to see and solve the nav bar problem.The code and steps are given.

        <h2>
            <li>Picture size problem </li>

        </h2>
        <img src="../images/picturesizeproblem.png" alt="forest" style="width: 600px">  <img src="../images/picturesizeproblemsolved.png" alt="forest" style="width: 600px"> 
        
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="researchpage">
            <p>The above two images are about the comparison between the a page with picture problem and solved one.In the first picture 
                we see that the loaded picture size is bigger and doesn't match the requirement.It's big and seems like a background because 
                of its size.The second picture shows  the solved one looks. It is understandable and clean to look.So for this we will have to 
                have to write "style width" and write the size like i have written "600px" from this we can solve the problem of picture size problem
                This was easy to solve .The size depends on the user it can be anysize we want ,to put the picutre we just have to load the picture 
                load it in the same folder as our index html and css.Then we should put the code src="./images/navbarproblem.png" alt="forest" style="width: 600px">
                it will load the picture just like I have done above.
