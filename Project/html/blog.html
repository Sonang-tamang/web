        their for job or just for fun but gaming are causing many health issues and many are becoming addicts.People forget food sleep

        are also outcome of murders and self harm deu to gaming.we do save out time and energy with the technology but the effects are 
        too much and the impacts  gaming Society is giving it's not good.
      </p>
      
      <b><p>Online Shoppings and business</p></b>
      <img src="../images/960x0.png" alt="forest" style="width: 500px">
      <p> One shopping is one of the biggest business currently going on each and every business are done online so that their 
        items are sold and gain profit but there are many pages which scammed people.Still many items are sold online .People dont 
        go out for shopping they buy all items online which made the physicals shop in loss.Globalization of online business are 
        leading loss on brokers who do job as a mid worker for importing or buying things.
      </p>
      <p><b>Communication</b></p>
      <img src="../images/communication.png" alt="forest" style="width: 500px">
      <p>People nowdays can communicate through different parts of the world.This is a good revolution but the health issues and 
        misuse are increasing day by day.Some users communicate and are hacked leading to exposure of their information,financial 
        information etc.We can do many things online and send messages to anyone from any part to anywhere.We can work with anyone but this
        features come with lot of misuse too.
      </p>
<p><b>Marketing</b></p>

<p>Before use of technology marketing were done in a Traditional way were the feedback and broadcast were in a done  through research.
  Now marketing are done without knowing the effects of products or true reviews.Auto reviews are added in Marketing leading to cosumers 
  desatisfaction.In this too people are getting scammed too They are told to give the money first and then blocked by the online market 
  page owner.We will have to do some  more security on this.
</p>
<p><b>Online Money Exchange</b></p>
<img src="../images/onlinemoneyexchange.png" alt="forest" style="width: 500px">
<p>Betting is one of the  main things done online.Many earn profit but many lose their money.Manyy people are scammed with online Betting 
  and some get financial problems with online betting.We will have to stop doing online money exchange or betting because scammers are 
increasing day by day.We shouldn't trust anyone who wants our financial information.We should always use extra security always keep our information
safe and not login in any scam email. </p>

<p><b>Cybersecurity challenges</b></p>
<img src="../images/cybersecuity.png" alt="forest" style="width: 500px">
<p>When technology are used daily to daily there are many problems to be faced like Cybersecurity.people can get scammed or hacked 
  within a second.Different scam link or hacking links are forwarded by hacked accounts which are clicked by other users which leads to 
  information hacking.Our infomation can be hacked any time any where so we should always be prepared .We have to think of the consequences
  we will face if we login in any scam email or links.Even our infomation can be hacked through internet use.So some extra security should 
  be done
